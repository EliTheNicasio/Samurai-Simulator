README

This is the first version of "Tactical UI".
The element list will grow in future updates so the examples and pre-made content, all without any extra fee.

With this package you can build diegetic UI elements and systems in no time, without any Canvas object.

In order to start constructing prefabs, just select the items you desire to compose
your UI element from the folder structure.

Ready-to-use Prefab folders are structured the following way:

    _Animated Sprites
    _Combined Mesh Elements
    _Letter Prefabs
    _Mesh Elements
    _Number Prefabs

Over 60 elements with both black and white versions, depending your project's mood.
The PDF list contains every item included, with their respective names.

There are several quick tips videos about this package in the product description, also
there are 3 demo scenes included so you can see how items are built. Feel free to modify them and make it part of your next project!

Elements can be combined with scripting in order to gain more presence in the scene.
You can have trigger volumes to enable/disable UI elements, add animation curves to gain attention from the player
or add mouse interaction to make some cool UX.
